Project introduction: \
The main purpose of this website is to advertise Valorant. Valorant is a 5v5 character-based tactical shooter where 2 teams have to fight each other to either plant the spike and defend it until it explodes or defuse it before it explodes. Many agents, maps and weapens are available to make the game more exciting and competitive.

Design Process: 
This website is mainly for competitive gamers who's forte is first person shooters, but others are more than welcome to just play the game for fun. I believe every gamer wants a simple, easy-to-navigate website when exploring games on websites and I believe my website does just that. It is a minimalist style UI where users may easily find the content they are looking for.
